## :computer: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create a function that, given a list of numbers (example `[1, 3, 6, 43, 6]`), calculate, **recursively**, how many elements are in the list and return that value.

For example, we have the following input e expected output for the function that receves the list:

```bash
iex> ListLength.call([1, 2, 3, 5, 7])
...> 5
```
